### Tech Stack
* React
* Starton
* Solidity
* Hardhat

## Quickstart guide
### Installation
* Install node with npm
* clone the project
* Enter the following command
* ```cd FUNDSARESAFE/funds-are-safe```
* ```npm i```
* ```npm start```

## Smart Contract
We wrote a Funding.sol contract in our hardhat project subdirectory to handle the funding of a project, in any kind of ERC-20, therefore we could choose USDC, wETH, MATIC...). 

## Features
The react page is static, meaning we can host it on IPFS and have a decentralized distribution and creation of crowd-funding campaign with a trustless coin management.
