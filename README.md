# "QUICKSTARTER"

A crowd-funding platform entirely decentralized using Ethereum (here deployed on Ropsten Network) and IPFS.

### Tech Stack
* React
* Starton
* Solidity
* Hardhat

##Smart Contract
We wrote a Funding.sol contract in our hardhat project subdirectory to handle the funding of a project, in any kind of ERC-20, therefore we could choose USDC, wETH, MATIC...). 

##Features
The react page is static, meaning we can host it on IPFS and have a decentralized distribution and creation of crowd-funding campaign with a trustless coin management.
